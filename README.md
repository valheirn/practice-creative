**Notes**
1. To change nav's color to transparent, use `class=bg-transparent` on CSS
2. To make the webpage responsive without relying to grind, use `@media screen and (min-width: 768px)` on CSS. However, there is something we've to pay attention. Like, in this case where we are aiming for `h1`. Previously we use `#intro h1`, but it has more importance than `@media screen and (min-width: 768px)`. So we need to change `#intro h1` to `.intro h1`
